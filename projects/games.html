      <!--Raver -->
      <p>
        During the Winter I took an experimental Game Art course with <a class="purple" href="http://ricksilva.net/"> Rick Silva </a>. 
        This was my first exposure to using game engines and 3D programs. I plan on experimenting with them much more in the future. 
      </p>
        <p>The first game I made is called Enigma Stones. It is playable on <a class="red" href="https://justinkau.itch.io/enigma-stones">itch.io<a/>.
            Unfortunately, it runs very slowly in the browser.

            My second game, Infinite Raver, is still in beta. An open version of the game is available on <a class="orange" href="https://github.com">
            github.com</a>.
