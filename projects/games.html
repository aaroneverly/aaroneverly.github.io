      <p>
        During the Winter I took an experimental Game Art course with <a class="purple" href="http://ricksilva.net/"> Rick Silva </a>. 
        This was my first exposure to using game engines and 3D programs. I plan on experimenting with them much more in the future.

        <p class="center">The first game I made is playable on <a href="https://justinkau.itch.io/enigma-stones">itch.io<a/>. WARNING: it demands a lot 
          of CPU and GPU and will likely run slowly in the browser.</p>
